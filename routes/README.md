# E-COMMERCE 

## Description 
For this assignment we will be focusing on the back-end of a e-commerce application. We will be configuring a working Express.js API and use Sequalize to interact with a MySQL database. This will help us to better understand the fundamentals of other similar e-commerce platforms.

## User Story
A manager at an internet retail company wants a back end for their e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that their company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Directions 
To test our application:
After entering schema and seed commands, a database is created and the data is seeded. 
Then entering 'node server.js' to start port listening. 
Next would be to run Postman with created routes and data will be displayed. 
When creating, updating, or deleting data it is done sucessfully.


## Acceptance Criteria 
Given a functional Express.js API
When adding database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
Then user is able to connect to a database using Sequelize
When entering schema and seed commands
Then a development database is created and is seeded with test data
When entering the command to invoke the application
Then server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
When opening API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
Then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
When testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
Then are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
